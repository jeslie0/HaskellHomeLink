* Description
This project came to be to help me control various devices in my home remotely - primarily to be able to control a radio for my dog to listen to while I am at work. I don't have permissions to change my home's networking, so I came up with the idea of using a proxy on a server I do control.

* Project status
This project is currently in development, with no release schedule. The ideas and structure of it are still being developed and may change as time goes on.

* Installation and setup
This project is primarily packaged with Nix. As it grows, components will also be packaged as Docker Images and hopefully deb packages.

* Project overview
This project consists of several different applications that run in different locations. These are:
- Home application (high side);
- Proxy application (low side);
- Web GUI (hosted on the low side, run on low side).

The Home application controls various devices at the user's home, such as radios, smart lights or smart cameras. It establishes a TLS+ProtoBuf connection to the Proxy application, which is running on a remote server somewhere else. The user then communicates with the Proxy application by a Web GUI, which is served using TLS.

Mutual TLS will be used for every connection, to allow each device to trust the device it is talking to.
